This repository contains an Ansible RHEL 9 Supplemental STIG Playbook intended to supplement DISA STIG content and help automate system hardening tasks.

## Purpose

- Provide an Ansible-based STIG remediation playbook to supplement official DISA guidance.
- Help users adapt and automate portions of their hardening workflow in their own environments.
- Serve as a starting point for review, testing, and customization rather than a drop-in guarantee of compliance.

## Before You Run It

- Review the playbook and every change it makes before execution.
- Test in a non-production environment first.
- Create a verified backup or snapshot of the target system before use.
- Confirm the settings match your platform, mission, and local security requirements.
